# Flights_Dataset
A Jupyter notebook to analyze data from the Kaggle datasetflight-delays.

The tasks we performed:

Task 1: We would like you to left join flights with airlines and airports. We described number of rows, null values. Also, we described  cleaning processes taht i found necessary.

Task 2: We  performed an analysis in the top 10 airports in terms of departure delay. We created a metric to rank each airport according to the average number of aircraft that departed from that airport having a delay > 15 mins. We then decided if such a metric would be efficient to compare airports and gave a suggestion to a better metric more inclusive.

Task 3: We found the association, between these top 10 airports and the aircraft that had no previous arrival delay (delay < 15) on a given day but they had arrival delay > 15 mins as soon as they departed from these airports. We then created  metrics and plots to indicate the existence of such a phenomenon.
